Create a droplet
    Access through terminal
        ssh root@IpMachine
            Add new user
                adduser
                    go-tickets
                password > to run commands sudo
                    09876c0459803ffa354321
                    y > to confirm
            Add this user to group sudo
                usermod -aG sudo go-tickets
                Verify if the user was add
                    su - go-tickets
            Create directory and copy ssh-keys on ~/root/.ssh to folder .ssh
                mkdir .ssh
                Access directory .ssh
                    cd .ssh
                        sudo cd /root/.ssh/authorize_keys .
                    Verify if all files was copied
                        ls -al
                        In this case we need change owner of ssh-keys
                            Change owner ssh key
                                sudo chown go-tickets:go-tickets authorize_keys
                            Verify if changes was success
                                ls -al
            exit of droplet
        Now we'll access with user go-tickets
            ssh go-tickets@IpMachine
        exit to go out of IdMachine
    Disable user root in droplet
        Access droplet with user that we create before
            ssh go-tickets@IpMachine
                Edit file sshd with nano
                    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                        Change this line:
                            Default is:
                                PermitRootLogin yes
                            Change to
                                PermitRootLogin no
                        After this step we need restart service sshd
                            sudo service ssh restart
                        Exit of IdMachine
                    Try access droplet with user root
                        This action was not allowed
